## C Learning Exercise Files   
This repository contains all the exercise files I did while learning C programming language. I will reference directories based on the books I used.  
So, the directory name is the name of the book I used.

**0x00-starlit** folders in each directory, contain all the self-exercises I did applying the concepts I learnt from the tutorials.

That is all for  now, I will update more incase there is anything to tell : )
