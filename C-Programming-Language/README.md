# The C Programming Language (K&R)

All the exercises in this folder are from The **C Programming Language** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (the founder of C programming language).

This are just exercise source codes not otherwise. I like keeping track of my progress, and this is the best way to do it, to me.
